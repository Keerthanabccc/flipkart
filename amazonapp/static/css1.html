        A long time ago, a wealthy king had three beautiful daughters. They had everything they wanted offered to them
        on a platter of gold. However, only one thing was lacking in their life, none of them had a husband, nor did
        they have a suitor. This made the king very unhappy. He had food, but he could not eat. What shall we do now?
        He asked his wife.I want my children to be happily married, but they think that no one is good enough for them.
        The king daughter were however not bothered. “I want to marry the richest man alive,” said the oldest sister. “I
        want to marry the most handsome man,” the younger sister said arrogantly. As for the youngest sister, “I want to
        marry a king like my father. Only he will be richer and more powerful. Oh! What a life I shall live being the
        queen of a great empire.” Their mother the queen added, “Whoever marries my daughters will be a lucky man,
        seeing how beautiful they all are. Oh no! My daughters will only marry the best men in the whole land.”
        The king heart was very troubled. He told his wife, “ i am finding my daughters men who will love and care for
        them. I will not watch them grow old without husbands and children.”
        Do whatever you want, said the queen, but my daughters will only marry anyone who can tell their names. That
        way, I will be sure they are marrying the wisest man in the entire land.
